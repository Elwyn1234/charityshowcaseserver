Local dev setup:
On Windows, download MySQL Installer and run through this process. When creating the root user, use the password o1M@2UO4ngwg!i9R$3hvLSVpt. Additionally, a DB Manager user needs to be created with the username of ejoh. This user's password should be set to YEVT4w2^N4uv2q48TnA9#k&ep. The passwords need to be set to these values because these are the values that are used in the code when connecting to the database. It is important that MySQL is setup to use port 3307.
Go also needs to be installed. Then install the database by navigating/'cd'ing into the util directory contained in this directory. From here run 'go run . install -f' which will create the database and add some test data. Once these are installed, run the command 'go run .' from this directory to start the directory.
